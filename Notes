##Objectives

- To raise awareness at GFU about the blockchain and crypocurrency. 
My hope is that by doing so the Univesity and its students won't miss out on what some would 
agree to be one of the most important inventions in the history of mankind. 
- To continue to bridge the gap between computer scientists and other disciplines.


##Notes

- Try to list all disciplines that blockchain encompasses and include real world examples.
